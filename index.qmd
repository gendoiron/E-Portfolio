### About Me

Creative, adaptable, and organized. I am a passionate geomatician, interested in equitable climate change adaptation, urban planning, and conservation. I have experience in the environment and equity sectors with competencies in research, mapping, field work, and outreach.

I am currently pursuing a Masters in Geomatics for Environmental Management at the University of British Columbia.

This website is living repository showcasing the works, both personal and professional, that I am proud of.
